# THERMO_THRUST
Thermodynamics Telemetry for Ideal Internal Combustion Engines Using Python

# Project Description:
Our team of four successfully developed a comprehensive Python-based simulation tool for analyzing and visualizing the Otto and Diesel engine cycles. The project involved implementing a graphical user interface (GUI), detailed cycle computations, and real-time data logging into a CSV file with timestamps.

# Key Features:
1. **GUI with ASCII Art Introduction**:
   - Developed using Tkinter to provide an interactive and visually appealing interface.
   - Displays an ASCII art title screen with customizable dimensions and style.

2. **Otto Cycle Simulation**:
   - **Graphing Function**: Plots the pressure-volume (P-V) diagram for the Otto cycle.
   - **Thermal Analysis**: Computes temperatures, power, efficiency, and cooling coefficients.
   - **Real-time Data Logging**: Appends cycle parameters, power output, efficiency, and other metrics into a CSV file with the current date and time.

3. **Diesel Cycle Simulation**:
   - **Graphing Function**: Plots the P-V diagram for the Diesel cycle.
   - **Thermal Analysis**: Computes temperatures, power, efficiency, and cooling coefficients.
   - **Real-time Data Logging**: Appends cycle parameters, power output, efficiency, and other metrics into a CSV file with the current date and time.

4. **Data Capture and Analysis**:
   - **CSV Logging**: Captures and stores detailed cycle data for each simulation run, including pressure, volume, temperature, power, and efficiency metrics.
   - **Real-time Timestamps**: Each entry is recorded with the precise date and time of the simulation for accurate data tracking and analysis.

# Technologies and Libraries Used:
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and array operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting P-V diagrams and temperature-time graphs.
- **SciPy**: For numerical integration and other scientific computations.
- **Tkinter**: For developing the GUI.
- **Colorama**: For colored terminal text output.
- **CSV**: For data logging and storage.

# Achievements:
- Successfully simulated and visualized both Otto and Diesel cycles.
- Enhanced understanding of thermodynamic cycles and their practical applications.
- Developed a user-friendly interface for ease of simulation.
- Implemented robust data logging for comprehensive cycle analysis.

# Learning Outcomes:
- Gained hands-on experience with Python programming and various scientific libraries.
- Improved skills in data visualization and GUI development.
- Learned to work collaboratively in a team, managing project timelines and responsibilities.

This project demonstrates our ability to combine theoretical knowledge with practical programming skills to create a functional and educational tool. We are proud of our collaborative effort and the final product, which can be used for further study and research in thermodynamics and engine cycles.
